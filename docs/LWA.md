## Create Security Profile

You will need to create a [Security Profile](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/create-security-profile.html) 

You will then get a Client ID and a CLient Secret, which you will need later. Since I am using Hekoku I have entered these as CONFIG_VARS


You will also need to set-up your allowed origins and allowed return URLS to point to your website.
